# ChatClient
Allows up to 3 users on the same connection to chat with each other using the sockets API.

This project implements a chat client that is able to communicate with a server. The client sends
messages to the server, which then broadcasts the message to all the other
clients on the system. Similarly, the client receives messages directly from
the server, thus enabling the user to read messages sent by all other clients on the system.
